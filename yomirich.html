    <p>"Yomi Rich" is the name she chose after finding out about her identity and the importance of names. Her official names are Naomi Mueni Wambua. After clearing her High School education, Yomi attended the prestigious University of Nairobi for her undergraduate degree in Bachelor of Commerce. She has always been quick at seeing business gaps. Every time she saw a gap, she thought of a way to fill that business gap through technology. So, in May 2019, she joined one of the best schools in Software Engeneering. She is currently enrolled in the school and looks forward to publishing her first project, which she did on her third week of coding. </p>
    <p>She enjoys talking to people, sharing what she has learnt and learning from them at the same time. She believes that there is so much in her; she is a giver, always looking forward to changing lives. Her favourite saying..."You can only say you are a success if you are influencing your world with your personality." </p>
