# Portfolio Landing Page
#### This project is a portfolio of a company I have began, a brief description of myself and some background information too.
#### By Naomi Mueni Wambua
## Description
I have created Opulence. A tech company/ a community of software developers that solves the needs in our society using technology.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Technologies Used
I used HTML and CSS. I created different htmls for each page. ie, home, contact, accomplishments and about us, to make the page more appealing.
